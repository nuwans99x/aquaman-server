# Identity
 
## We need to support authentication and authorization
## The users can be stored inside the DB hosted in Azure
## User access and role based experience (2 roles admin and normal user)
## Refer the section "Admin functionality" for the admin operations
## Refer the section "Normal user functionality" for the normal user operations
## Create the needed UIs and bind the APIs for these operations
## The client repo is refered as aquaman-client
## The server repo is refered as aquaman-server

# Admin functionality

## CRUD new products
## Update stocks of the products
## Invalidate users for security reasons

# Normal user functionality

## Register by themselves (self sign up)
## Purchase items (add to the cart, and pay)
## Payment can be mocked for now, since we don't have a payment gateway
